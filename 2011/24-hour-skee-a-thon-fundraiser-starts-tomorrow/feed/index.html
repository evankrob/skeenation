		<description>Andrew &quot;kennesaw kid&quot; Boyd  and Brad &quot;bearcat&quot; Sims are coming to super saturday in raleigh this weekend. We might possibly be accompanied by Brandon &#8220;The Makers Marksman&#8221; Harris.  
Here is my proposition to those who might care to accept. We would like to take on challengers in a 2 on 2 or 3 on 3 match while we are in raleigh for super saturday (3&#039;s if accompanied by Harris). I&#039;m willing to put up 30-60 per match, where 50% goes to Liam and 50% to winners (beyond our money to play, and if possible our play money can be donated if this is allowed by the bar/SkeeEO of that league??? idk but someone let me know) 
This will be for us to represent ATL in the fundraiser for Liam, and to see who wants to take on some up and comer&#039;s from the South. Respond with challengers, and those who might be interested. </description>

		<description>Since I&#039;m pretty sure Evan&#039;s right about Mouth and his cronies...and I&#039;m pretty sure that anyone who didn&#039;t know who to vote for voted for El Duke&#039;...and I&#039;m pretty sure everyone else voted for themselves and/or TOLD their friends to vote for them...I&#039;m going on record that WB&#039;s got The Dozen in this one. &#039;Nuff said.</description>

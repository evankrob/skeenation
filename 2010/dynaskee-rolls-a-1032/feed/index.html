		<description>I would have a goatee if I could grow one!  I am in my offskeeson mode and will get back to fighting weight when i feel like not eating (which will be never).  As for CT, you remind me of the little guy that jumps out of the trunk of the car in the movie &quot;The Hangover&quot; and the guy says &quot;why is he sooo angry?&quot;  Is it because you have rolled 4 weeks and we have only rolled 3 and we are still up 320?</description>

		<description>HAHAHA! Ray needs the goatee though. Also, have you ever owned a farm? There are cows to milk, eggs to collect, crops to harvest, trees to plant; sure the butterflies are a great perk, but there is more to farming then building barns.  I mean, what good is a groovy barn or a red barn gonna do ya if you don&#039;t have the items to fill them?  But I can&#039;t pick on them though, COD MW2 takes up a good chunk of my time as well. That and extorting corrupt judges on mafia wars.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find your Hundo,&lt;br&gt;Mr. Burgundy</description>

		<description>Burgandy the only reason you are on this team is because the significant others of your two d-bag teamamtes can&#039;t stomach spending any extra time with them. Lets face it, Ray looks like an overweight Bret Farve and Duke spends eight hours a day building barns and finding magic butterflies in farmville. you three deserve each other.</description>

		<description>&quot;A sports dynasty is a team that dominates their sport or league for multiple seasons or years. &quot; - Wikipedia &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Thanks for the info Wiki.  So a team that wins once(BD) is far from a dynasty, just saying.&lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;We could, and would destroy the &quot;OneHitWonders&quot; up the middle...no doubt about it.  You just won&#039;t see it during the Season 4.  &lt;br&gt;&lt;br&gt;Find your Hundo!</description>

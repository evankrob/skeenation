		<description>Agreed. I hate the Chuck E Cheese reference. When I was a kid (yeah back in the fucking 80&#039;s) I was more interested in playing Galaga or even stealing a swig off the old man&#039;s overpriced beer 
(maybe that&#039;s what&#039;s wrong with me). Honestly I don&#039;t even remember skeeball lanes being there. All I remember is those creepy characters who played in that lame muppet band with the maze underneath the stage. I&#039;m surprised Chis Hansen wasn&#039;t there. Maybe all that was after my time. When Gen Y or Z went to Chuck E Cheese I&#039;m sure I was doing keg stands at some frat house. My experience with skeeball was at a local amusement park in high school where I took some 14 year old&#039;s v-card. I guess that&#039;s why I&#039;m a seasoned vet with multiple final four appearances, a Chalice in hand and a HRT trophy in the garage. Let the good times roll.</description>

		<description>So what you&#039;re saying is, you hope that one day, Skeenation is on par with a $10/hour hotel?  Don&#039;t forget, Farrell, you can charge $5 for the sheets.</description>
